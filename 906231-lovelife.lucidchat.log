[10:01:07] <%Bhanu> [21:58:30] but its generally a normal command promt
[10:01:07] <FatShiftry> [21:58:33] Can someone help me to get lucky patcher for my iOS device version 10.2 :3?
[10:01:07] <%Bhanu> [21:58:48] if we root we can do all unrestricted things there
[10:01:07] <%Bhanu> [21:59:03] like downloading any thing on the terminal
[10:01:07] <%Bhanu> [21:59:14] root = superuser
[10:01:07] <%Bhanu> [21:59:16] su
[10:01:07] <%Bhanu> [21:59:17] sudo
[10:01:07] <%Bhanu> [21:59:27] there are many commands like that
[10:01:07] <%Bhanu> [21:59:43] i think youre a begginer
[10:01:07] <kang00> [21:59:51] First I would not like to break  existing Windows
[10:01:07] <%Bhanu> [21:59:59] yes
[10:01:07] <FatShiftry> [22:00:00] guess not 
[10:01:07] <kang00> [22:00:09] Hence my first project could be using Linux without root
[10:01:07] <kang00> [22:00:19] And once it's successful
[10:01:07] <%Bhanu> [22:00:21] you run linuc shell on ur existing windows
[10:01:07] <kang00> [22:00:26] Next project can be rooting
[10:01:07] <kang00> [22:00:33] How?
[10:01:07] <%Bhanu> [22:00:36] and one more you cant root ur command prompt
[10:01:07] <%Bhanu> [22:00:48] no you cant root
[10:01:07] <kang00> [22:00:56] Why
[10:01:07] <%Bhanu> [22:01:19] youre downloading linux shell right
[10:01:07] <kang00> [22:01:26] Yes I am beginner without pc
[10:01:07] <%Bhanu> [22:01:36] so it will automatically generated
[10:01:07] <%Bhanu> [22:01:40] with root
[10:01:07] <kang00> [22:01:54] I am confused what you mean
[10:01:07] <%Bhanu> [22:02:07] ok is ur system restricted?
[10:01:07] <%Bhanu> [22:02:18] or unrestricted (root)
[10:01:07] <kang00> [22:02:22] Can we segregate our steps?
[10:01:07] <kang00> [22:02:32] Step be step?
[10:01:07] <%Bhanu> [22:02:36] ok

[11:01:52] <@Peer> [04:17:29] I see. 
[11:01:52] <@Peer> [04:19:20] IRCCLoud makes you only 24hrs for just 7 days only. After that you can stay for 2hrs away then quit.
[11:01:52] <@Peer> [04:20:16] And I don't suggest you use IRCCloud with your bnc.
[11:01:52] <@Peer> [04:20:23] It will be very lag.
[11:01:52] <@Peer> [04:21:11] Because you connect to irccloud server, then irccloud connects to bnc, then bnc connects to the server you want.

[19:01:01] <@Peer> [18:25:57] he never change
[19:01:01] <@Peer> [18:26:08] Well its his channel though
[19:01:01] <%Nana> [18:26:16] ??
[19:01:01] <@Peer> [18:26:54] im talking about d1g1t
[19:01:01] <%Nana> [18:30:01] Oh ok
[19:01:01] <%Nana> [18:30:15] Ikr:(
[19:01:01] <@Peer> [18:32:00] I tell you one thing.
[19:01:01] <@Peer> [18:32:47] One of our guys made auto catch script way back dec 2015. He realized one thing
[19:01:01] <@Peer> [18:33:01] That all pokemons have specific tiles.
[19:01:01] <@Peer> [18:33:18] They do not appear in random.
[19:01:01] <@Peer> [18:34:39] He realized it because everytime he steps on the tile he (the script) records where he found the pokemon
[19:01:01] <%Nana> [18:34:54] Lol
[19:01:01] <@Peer> [18:35:35] when he tells thescript to find example: shiny pikachu
[19:01:01] <@Peer> [18:35:57] the script runs towards the tile where he found shiny pikachu
[19:01:01] <%Nana> [18:36:18] Lmao
[19:01:01] <@Peer> [18:37:09] also
[19:01:01] <@Peer> [18:37:23] All the people who are reading this
[19:01:01] <@Peer> [18:37:43] thank me later XD

[19:01:01] <%Nana> [18:39:44]  Lmao 
[19:01:01] <@Peer> [18:41:45] I dont have proof but you can try it :)
